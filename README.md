registry
========

The service registry provides the master list of U.S. IOOS data providers and IOOS data web services that provide data in U.S. IOOS DMAC-compliant means.  The registry is the official record of what is included in and excluded from U.S. IOOS.  

The service registry is hosted and operated by NGDC.  To submit your service to the registry, contact the IOOS Program at ioos.catalog@noaa.gov

What is the time it takes for the service to show up in the Regional WAFs, after it is approved? 
A new service should show up in the IOOS test Web Accessible Folder (WAF) within 24 hours after it is approved. 
Is this a manual process or automatic? 
Service harvesting runs automatically every night. 
How long until it is in the system status list [IOOS System Service Monitor]  
After a service is 'APPROVED' in the registry [Google Fusion Table], 
We [NGDC] manually generate a new configuration file for the monitoring service (we would like to change this part of the workflow). 
The monitor checks services every morning (around 6am) and the new services should be visible at that time. 
Proposed Actions: 
Some potential changes to the Google Fusion table: 
Add ‘submit_date’ column to the Google Fusion table. 
Addition of another status level, such as ‘PROCESSED’
Anna Milan suggested addition; Rob Ragsdale agreed that if not too burdensome could be informative to know that an action has been taken on the approved service and another status level would be useful.
